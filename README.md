## Open Payments
Open Payments is an open API standard that can be implemented by account servicing entities (e.g. banks, digital wallet providers, and mobile money providers) to facilitate interoperability in the setup and completion of payments for different use cases including:

- Web Monetization
- Tipping/Donations (low value/low friction)
- eCommerce checkout
- P2P transfers
- Subscriptions
- Invoice Payments

An Open Payments server runs two sub-systems, a resource server which exposes APIs for performing functions against the underlying accounts and and authorisation server which exposes APIs compliant with the GNAP standard for getting grants to access the resource server APIs.

## Project RoadMap
This project will draw inspiration from the typescript Open Payments SDK with a python implementation. The goal is to have the SDK library(s) hosted on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) therefore installable via pip

Here is an outline of the project implementation roadmap and release timelines
